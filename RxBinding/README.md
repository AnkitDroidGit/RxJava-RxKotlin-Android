# RxBinding

Rx is powerful because we can compose transformations. What that means is that we can have reusable, safe and more functional code that simply plugs into your code.

As an example let’s say we’re making a login screen with an email and a password…

Consider the following rules that we want for our email addresses

- Length should be greater than 6
- Should have a correct email pattern
- Let the user know if any of the above fails
- On each key stroke, verify
